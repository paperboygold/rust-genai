//! Internal stream event types that serve as an intermediary between the provider event and the GenAI stream event.
//!
//! This allows for flexibility if we want to capture events across providers that do not need to
//! be reflected in the public ChatStream event.
//!
//! NOTE: This might be removed at some point as it may not be needed, and we could go directly to the GenAI stream.
